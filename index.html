            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
              not defined</code
            >
          </p>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <p><code>let y = 13.</code></p>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).
          </li>

          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
            write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");</code
            >
          </p>
          <li>This is an item list</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
